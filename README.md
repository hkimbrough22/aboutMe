## About Me

This website is about myself, Haustin Kimbrough.  The site is being slowly added to for Code 201. I have added improved functionality with the HTML, CSS, and JS. The website features pictures from the last few years of my life and contains my different social media and contact information.

My most recent update has been to work with [Abdi Mohamed](https://github.com/abdimohamed121) to add JS functions for my introductory yes/no questions, guessing game questions, and score keeper. Abdi was the driver and I was the navigator for this.

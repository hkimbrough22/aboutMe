<p>
Hello! I'm Haustin. I am originally from Kentucky, but Tennessee is a close second. I currently reside in Arizona, but plan to relocate after completion of Codefellows coding bootcamp. I am married to my beautiful wife, Shania, and we have a lovely litte 6-month old angel named Winter Sofia. Shania and I met in San Antonio, TX while we were both stationed there in the Army. We both come from an intelligence background, but are attempting to leave that behind for software development. I love a lot of things that involve outdoors including bonfires, BBQ-ing, and deer hunting.  I also enjoy a nice bourbon! When I was a younger man, I went to a few concerts for Mayday Parade, All Time Low, and Young The Giant. I also enjoy video games: I used to play a lot of Halo, Call of Duty, and other first-person shooters, but now I really only play <a href="https://www.runescape.com">Runescape</a> and Heroes of the Storm (by Blizzard).

      <h3>Job Experience</h3>
      <p>
      I am a veteran of the US Army. Before that I worked some odd jobs as a church daycare employee and some manual labor for a general contractor in my hometown. The last two and a half years I have been an educator for the US Army - teaching higher-level learning for other Human Intelligence Collectors. I loved that job as every day was different. Some days were behind a computer, others I could be giving platform instruction, and others I spent nearly all day role-playing for students and giving constructive feedback and critiques.

      <h3>Education</h3>
      <p>
      I have attended a lot of secondary education starting about a decade ago.  First I went to a smaller NAIA school called Campbellsville University in Campbellsville, KY from 2009 to 2010. At CU, I played baseball for the junior varsity team as a pitcher and did some general education studies. I left CU for the University of Louisville the next year and did basically the same thing (minus the baseball stuff).  Here I had to take an Introduction to Computer Programming course that focused on the C and C++ programming languages. Even though I didn't do the best in the course, it was where I found out I really liked programming. My next education adventure was relatively shortly thereafter through the military. I attend Advanced Individual Training, or AIT as it is called in the Army, as a Human Intelligence Collector. The local college just outside the military base had a program that allowed students of the AIT to simply fill out a form and receive college credits for the job they were learning to do in the military. So I was able to get about 27 credit hours just for signing my name and paying $50. After this, it was about eight years before I started back up at the University of Arizona in Tucson, AZ. By this time, I knew I wanted to own my own business one day so my course work was centered on Business Management. I recently left UofA to attend Codefellows and hope to go back for my Bachelor's at some point.

  <h3>Goals</h3>
  <p>
    I hope to one day have my own business. My dream started as wanting a food truck that sold sliders - they are the perfect snack-sized item that would sell great for people on the go! But I eventually realized that I really want to pursue entrepreneurship; so any business.  I like the idea of running things and making them efficient and being fair to employees, etc. I ultimately settled on the idea that one day I will use my veteran status to create a Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business - or SDVOSB as the federal government recognizes. I will use this to create a professional services procurement company that focuses on (hopefully) software development, intelligence, and IT. Professional services procurement is just a fancy way of saying I will find and hire people for the government. It can be lucrative and I hope so since my other goal is to retire by age 50. Big words, I know, but I think I can do it! Hope you liked my website!
